In this "metaprops" repository, I provide four rmd. files along with three real-life data sets and a simulated data set here as templates for conducting meta-analyses of proportions. 
The first template gives an example of how to conduct a meta-analysis of proportions with the logit transformation.
The second template gives an example of how to conduct a meta-analysis of proportions with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation.
The third template gives an example of how to conduct a meta-analysis of proprotions without performing a transformation.
These are three most commonly used transformation methods in the literatures. Personally, I have never seen any authors performing an arcsine transformation in their meta-analysis studies.
The last template employs a simuated data set I created in order to teach you how to conduct meta-regressions.  
The metafor package is our primary tool to do the work. I will also provide a template for conducting meta-analyses of proportions with the meta package. But, we will mainly focus on the metafor package.
With my templates, you can calculate average effect sizes, subgroup effect sizes, create forest plots, examine heterogeneity, conduct moderator analysis, perform meta-regressions, create funnel plots, conduct tests for publication bias, including trim and fill, Egger's test, Begg's rank correlation test, and Vevea and Hedges (1995) Weight-Function Model. You name it. The only thing you need to do is format your data as instructed and personalize the parameters in the templates. 
The results yielded by my templates are in accordance with those yielded by the meta package, Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, and Stata. Actually, they yiled exactly the same results.
Enjoy my templates:)
